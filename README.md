# Challenge Project: Find Your Hat

## Introduction

- This is project is part of the Codecademy [Full-Stack Engineer Pathway](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineering-cfb)
- This purpose of this project is to build an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.


## Plan

- Print instructions for user

- Keep implementing the following until user wins by finding their hat; loses by landing on (and falling in) a hole; or attempts to move “outside” the field.
    - Prompt user for input to indicate which direction they would like to move
    - Print result of current field with tiles they visited marked with '*'
